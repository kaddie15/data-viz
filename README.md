## üí°Project Overview
This project was developed for the purposes of the Data Visualization course (MSc in Computer Science) at the National 
and Kapodistrian University of Athens. It is a web application that allows users to get insights about Data Science 
jobs salaries. The project is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

In detail, this data visualization project aims to support tech university graduates and professionals in their quest 
for suitable career paths by harnessing valuable insights. The project presents a range of visualizations designed to

data cleaning and manipulation done to ensure that the data is in the correct format for our needs.
