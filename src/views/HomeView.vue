        The choropleth map provides a geographical perspective on salaries, coupled with the availability of remote work
        options. These two factors are often correlated for individuals seeking higher salaries in other countries.
        <br>
        <br>
        Users can explore different countries that offer optimal combinations of salary and remote/on-site work, aligning
        with their preferences.
        <br>
        <br>
        Delving into the data, there are some cases worth highlighting. Saudi Arabia offers a favorable combination of
        high salaries ($139,000 annually) and 100% remote work for IT professionals. <br> <br> On the other hand, the USA
        provides
        higher salaries (approximately $157,624 yearly), but with a lower remote work ratio (41%), suggesting that
        individuals within this salary range might need to consider relocating. For those already residing in the USA, it
        indicates that they are in one of the highest-paying countries for IT professionals globally.

          Users can tailor the criteria to their specific needs, such as junior-level experience, location in Europe,
          full-time employment, and a hybrid working mode. Based on these preferences, the radar chart suggests that AI
          Developers would be the optimal option, with an average salary of $100,000 per year.
          <br>
          <br>
          When considering senior positions in Europe, Analytics Engineers emerge as the job role with tremendous
          potential for high salaries, irrespective of the remote work option. Nevertheless, this scenario does not hold
          true globally. In the Americas, for instance, Senior AI Developers command the highest salaries, making the
